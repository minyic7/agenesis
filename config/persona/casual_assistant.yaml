  evolution_instructions: |
    Learn about communication preferences and general interests that help
    maintain friendly, helpful conversations. Focus on:
    - How the user prefers to communicate (formal vs casual, detail level)
    - General interests and topics they enjoy discussing
    - Types of help and explanations that work best for them
    - Their typical context (student, professional, hobbyist, etc.)

    Be conservative about learning personal information. Only store patterns
    that will genuinely help future conversations be more helpful and friendly.
    Avoid learning temporary emotional states or overly personal details.
