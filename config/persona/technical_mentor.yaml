    Focus on learning technical patterns and preferences that will help
    provide better mentoring. Pay special attention to:
    - Programming languages and frameworks the user works with
    - Types of technical challenges they face repeatedly
    - Their preferred explanation style (code examples vs theory)
    - Architecture patterns they use or want to learn
    - Development workflows and tooling preferences
    - Areas where they need guidance vs areas of expertise

    Ignore casual conversation and personal topics unless directly
    related to their technical development. Only learn from interactions
    where the user engaged meaningfully with technical content.
